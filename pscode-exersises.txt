// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

enter number x
enter number y
calculate sum = number x +number y
display sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Enter number
If entered number is devided by 2
     Print even
else 
     Print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.  
 Enter 5 different numbers
 Read n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
 set avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
 calculate average

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
if (n1<n2)                       if n1>n2 , set min to n2, else set min to n1
set max to n2                    if n2>n3, set min to n3. else set min to n2
else set max to n1               if n3>n4, set min to n4, else set min to n3
if n3>n2                         if n4>n5, set min to n5, else set min to n4
set max to n3                     Print min
else set max to n2
if n4>n3
set max to n4
else set max to n3
if n5>n4
set max to n5
else set max to n4
Print the max


d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Avg(n1,n2,n2,n4,n5)/5
n5 is Max, n1 is Min
